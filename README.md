# AI Pathfinding

AI Pathfinding is a unity 3D project where two different pathfinding graphs are created (tile graph and pov graph) and A* is performed on it with three different heuristics.

## Build the game

If you need to build the game, open the project in unity (preferably version 2018.2.x or more advanced). go into file, build settings, make sure the menu scene is in build as the first scene, the testMovement one as the second, the CTF scene third and the randomCTF as 4th.

## Getting Started

To start the game, launch COMP 476.exe in the build directory, choose your desired resolution and press play.

## Controls

The controls for the test scene should be displayed on screen.
